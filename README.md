# hello-world

Hi there!  My name is Lucas.  I am from Columbus, Ohio.  One thing you'll discover fairly quickly about me is that I love to sing.  I sing in the shower, the kitchen, as I'm walking up and down the stairs, the car, the bar, and everywhere in between.  Sometimes I'll even sing while I'm eating.  For example, I could be eating a delicious taco, and if one of my favorite songs come on the sound system... I'll just break out into song mid-bite.  

I hope we can become friends.  I wish you all much love.  Please introduce yourself to me, and tell me about yourself, and I'll do my best to keep the conversation going!  

-Luke
